### The Idea ###
GLEngine is a game-oriented javascript framework for developers using WebGL, aimed at providing features necessary to provide a better gaming experience on the web (and making it easy and intuitive to do). 

### Features ###
Features include (or will soon include):  

* Intuitive setup (make a world, add entities)
* Convenient "entity" system
* "Hook" system to handle world-scale and entity-scale events
* Abstracting away most complicated rendering processes
* Useful utility functions (e.g. simple vectors, colors)

Planned features include (?):  

* Voice chat
* Map loading and creating
* FPS-style first person camera (...if mouse locking ever becomes available)
* Multiplayer support with WebSockets
* Basic physics - gravity, collision, movement

### Thanks ####
This framework relies heavily on mrdoob's [three.js](http://www.github.com/mrdoob/three.js) for all of the rendering grunt work. I couldn't have gotten this far without that wonderful script.
