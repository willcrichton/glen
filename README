glengine
========

#### The Idea ####

GLEngine is a game-oriented javascript framework for developers using WebGL, aimed at providing features necessary to provide a better gaming experience on the web (and making it easy and intuitive to do). 

#### Features ####

Features include (or will soon include):
* Multiplayer support with WebSockets
* Basic physics - gravity, collision, movement
* Abstracting away most rendering processes, adding useful utility functions
* Map loading and creating
* FPS-style first person camera (...if mouse locking ever becomes available)

Planned features include (?):
* Rudimentary map creation system
* Voice chat

#### Thanks #####

This framework relies heavily on mrdoob's [three.js](http://www.github.com/mrdoob/three.js) for all of the rendering grunt work. I couldn't have gotten this far without that wonderful script.
